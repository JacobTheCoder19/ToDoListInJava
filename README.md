<h2><em>⚙️ How it works ⚙️</em></h2>

&emsp;To start off, I used the JavaFX library to design the graphical user interface (GUI). The application displays a text area listing current tasks and two buttons, "Add" and "Remove". Clicking the "Add" button opens an input dialog where the user can type a task. Once submitted, the task is added to the list, displayed in the text area, and saved to a file named "toDoList.txt". Clicking the "Remove" button prompts the user to enter the exact task they want to delete. If the task exists, it is removed from the list, and the updated list is displayed and saved.  

&emsp;The application reads tasks from the "toDoList.txt" file upon startup. That way it ensures the list is always up-to-date. Any changes are saved back to this file automatically. Alerts provide feedback to the user, confirming successful actions like adding or removing items or notifying of errors if something goes wrong (e.g., trying to remove a task that doesn't exist).  

&emsp;The design also includes hover effects on buttons for better interactivity and a calming teal background for an aesthetically pleasing experience. Simple yet effective, this to-do list program demonstrates core JavaFX features and file I/O while providing an efficient task management tool.
